## Challenge
During a hypothetical three-year mission to Mars and back, an eight-person crew would accumulate 12,600 kg of inorganic waste, or trash, including various packaging materials, textiles, and structural materials. This scenario creates a pressing need to recycle available materials, rather than execute the expensive and inefficient processes of transporting additional resources from Earth and/or sending trash back to Earth. As humans prepare to explore unknown worlds in the future, your challenge is to design sustainable systems that could manage, reuse, or recycle inorganic waste (“trash”) that is brought to and/or accumulated on the surface of Mars.

Potential Waste Materials: Consider incorporating the following types of waste materials into your project, but feel free to include others as well:

    Fabrics (e.g., clothing, washcloths, disinfectant wipes made with materials like cotton, cellulose, nylon, polyester)
    Food packaging (e.g., overwrap, rehydratable pouches, drink pouches, thermal pouches made with materials like polyester, polyethylene, aluminum, nylon)
    Structural elements for temporary structures (e.g., aluminum structures, polymer matrix composites with carbon fiber and plastic resin)
    Foam packaging (e.g., Zotek F30)
    EVA waste (e.g., cargo transfer bags made of Nomex, nylon, polyester)
    Other packaging and gloves (e.g., air cushions, bubble wrap, resealable bags, anti-static bubble wrap bags, Plastazote foam, nitrile gloves)

Potential End Products: Your project could produce a variety of end products including:

    Utensils
    Storage containers
    Interior habitat outfitting
    Various small tools
    Any other useful products you can think of!

## Solution

The project was structured to recycle plastics, metals, and textiles.

### Plastics

#### Shredding
- Separation by polymer type and removal of surface contaminants.
- Size reduction in a low-speed shredder until uniform flakes/chips are achieved.
- Closed-loop washing with controlled drying to remove moisture and residues.

#### Extrusion
- Pre-drying appropriate for hygroscopic polymers.
- Controlled melting in an extruder with a heated zone and conveying screw.
- Forcing the molten polymer through a die, with control of temperature, pressure, and cooling.

#### Compression
- Feed preparation with dried flakes/pellets.
- Hot pressing in a closed mold, with temperature and pressure control.
- Cooling under pressure for dimensional stabilization.

#### 3D Printer
- Feeding with appropriate extruded material.
- Layer-by-layer deposition with temperature and speed parameters adjusted to the material.
- Cooling and consolidation between layers for geometric integrity.

### Metals

#### Shredding
- Disassembly and separation of non-metallic components.
- Mechanical fragmentation to dimensions suitable for subsequent handling.
- Cleaning and drying to remove oil, moisture, and residues.

#### Pressing
- Compaction of fragments into briquettes to increase apparent density.
- Application of sufficient pressure for initial cohesion without melting.
- Mild thermal conditioning to eliminate trapped gases.

#### Metal extrusion
- Heating below the melting point in a controlled environment.
- Plastic deformation by solid-state extrusion to form rods and draw down to wire.
- Atmosphere control to minimize oxidation during forming.

#### Metal 3D printer
- Method: WAAM with wire feed.
- Preparation of wire with appropriate diameter and clean surface.
- Layer-by-layer deposition via controlled arc process (MIG/CMT), with thermal management between passes.

### Textiles

#### Non-synthetics
- Cleaning and drying for hygiene and dimensional stabilization.
- Cutting and preparation into formats suitable for subsequent processes.
- Organization by basis weight and weave for correct application.

#### Shredding
- Fragmentation into strips or flakes by manual or mechanical cutting.
- Size homogenization for consistent performance in forming.
- Storage in dry conditions to avoid degradation.

#### Compaction and needling
- Layering to form a web.
- Mechanical consolidation by needling or compression for fiber interlocking.
- Density adjustment by varying the number of layers and needling intensity.

#### Light thermal pressing
- Application of moderate heat and pressure to stabilize the formed web.
- Use of flat surfaces or molds to impart the desired geometry.
- Cooling under pressure for structural fixation.

#### Synthetics
- Cleaning and drying to remove contaminants.
- Preparation by cutting and organization according to basis weight and texture.
- Edge control by thermal sealing where applicable.

#### Shredding
- Reduction to flakes/strips with suitable tools.
- Classification by size for processing consistency.
- Storage in closed containers to avoid contamination.

#### Light thermal pressing
- Thermal lamination with pressure for cohesion between layers.
- Forming in shallow or flat molds with time and temperature control.
- Stabilization by controlled cooling to maintain shape.
